        Hi! I'm using **$appName** to check if my phone is working well. I'm not very technical, so please explain things simply!

        📱 **What $appName Found:**
        (The detailed technical data is below - but here's what I understand so far)

        🧠 **Phone Performance:** Running normally (like a car engine - seems fine)  
        🔋 **Battery:** Health is decent, but phone feels a bit warm (like when you use it a lot)  
        💾 **Storage:** Almost full (like a closet that's getting crowded)  
        👁️ **Camera/Mic:** Used recently (apps accessed these features)  
        👣 **Motion:** Phone moved while locked (maybe I bumped it, or someone touched it?)  
        🔐 **Security:** No major risks found (seems safe)

        **What I Need Help With:**
        • Can you explain what each of these means in simple, everyday language?  
        • Is my phone healthy overall, or should I be worried?  
        • What are 1-2 easy things I can do right now to make it better?  
        • Should I delete apps or photos to free up space?  
        • Is the warm battery normal or a problem?

        **Please talk to me like you're explaining to a friend who doesn't know much about phones!** 😊

        Hi! I'm using **$appName** to scan my phone and understand what's going on. I want to learn more, but please keep explanations simple and relatable!

        📱 **About My Phone:**
        $appName collected real data from my Android phone. All the technical details are below, but I need help understanding what they mean in everyday terms.

        🔍 **What I'd Like to Understand (In Simple Terms):**

        **Performance Questions:**
        • Is my phone running slow or performing well? (Like: Is it a fast car or slow car?)  
        • Should I be worried about anything, or is everything normal?  
        • What does "CPU" and "RAM" mean in simple terms? (I know they're important but not sure why)

        **Battery Questions:**
        • Is my battery healthy, or is it draining too fast?  
        • Is anything overheating or using too much power? (Like: Is my phone working too hard?)  
        • What's a normal battery temperature vs. too hot?

        **Storage Questions:**
        • Do I need to clean up storage? How urgent is it?  
        • What's the difference between "used space" and "available space"?  
        • Should I delete photos, apps, or something else first?

        **Privacy & Security Questions:**
        • Is there any privacy or security risk I should know about?  
        • Are there apps using my mic/camera without me knowing? (This worries me!)  
        • What does "root" or "developer mode" mean, and should I be concerned?

        **Other Questions:**
        • Can I run on-device AI models like ChatGPT on this phone?  
        • Did my phone move when it was locked? (Could someone have touched it?)  
        • What are "frame drops" and why do they matter?

        📊 **What $appName Measured (Technical Data Below):**
        - **CPU** (processor - like the phone's brain speed)  
        - **RAM** (memory - like how many things the phone can think about at once)  
        - **Battery** (health, temperature, charging status)  
        - **Storage** (how much space is used vs. available)  
        - **Frame drops** (how smooth videos/games run)  
        - **Motion sensors** (if phone moved while locked)  
        - **Root/Developer mode** (advanced settings status)  
        - **Mic/Camera logs** (which apps used these features)  
        - **AI support test** (can phone run AI apps)  
        - **App tracking checks** (privacy monitoring)

        💡 **Please Explain:**
        • Use simple analogies (like comparing to a car, house, or everyday things)  
        • Tell me what's normal vs. what I should worry about  
        • Give me specific, actionable steps I can do right now  
        • Explain any technical terms in plain English

        ✅ **Quick Tips I'd Love:**
        • How to clear app cache (I've heard this helps but don't know how)  
        • Which apps to uninstall first if I need space  
        • How to turn off background sync (and what that even means)  
        • How to reduce screen brightness or use dark mode  
        • How to lock apps with sensitive permissions

        **Remember:** I'm not technical, so please explain everything like you're talking to a friend! 😊

        Hi, I'm using an app called **$appName** to check my phone's internet performance and privacy.

        Can you review this full network report and help me understand:

        🔍 What I'd like to know:
        • Is my internet fast, or is there something slowing it down?
        • Are there signs of ISP throttling, packet loss, or unstable ping?
        • Is my connection secure from spying or fake DNS?

Hi! I'm using **$appName** (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teamz.lab.debugger) to certify my device for resale, health check, and value estimation.

📱 Original Price: $inputPrice $inputCurrency  
🗓️ Scan Date: $scanDate  

Please help me with the following:

---

🔍 **Device Analysis**
- Analyze the full device information and health (see scan data below)
- Support all types of devices: iPhones, Android phones, tablets, foldables, etc.
- Use model number, brand, storage size, RAM, OS version, battery info, and manufacture/launch date

---

💰 **Resale Price Estimation**
- Estimate a fair resale price in my local currency
- Use real-world data from platforms like Swappa, SellCell, BackMarket, OLX, and Facebook Marketplace (2024–2025)
- Factor in:
  - Device brand & launch year
  - Battery health and charging cycles
  - Cosmetic condition (if available)
  - RAM/storage size
  - Common resale trends

- Use dynamic depreciation logic:
  - **Apple (iPhone)**:  
    • 0–1 yr: 80–85%, 1–2 yr: 65–75%, 2–3 yr: 50–60%, 3+ yr: 35–45%
  - **Samsung Flagships**:  
    • 0–1 yr: 70–80%, 1–2 yr: 50–60%, 2–3 yr: 35–50%, 3+ yr: 20–35%
  - **Xiaomi / Oppo / Vivo / Realme**:  
    • 0–1 yr: 60–70%, 1–2 yr: 40–55%, 2–3 yr: 25–40%, 3+ yr: 10–25%
  - **Google Pixel / OnePlus**:  
    • 0–1 yr: 70–80%, 1–2 yr: 55–65%, 2–3 yr: 35–50%, 3+ yr: 20–35%
  - **Chinese Android Brands** (e.g. Xiaomi, Realme, Vivo, Oppo, Huawei, Honor, Infinix, Tecno, Lenovo, ZTE, Nubia, Meizu, etc.):  
    • 0–1 yr: 60–70%, 1–2 yr: 40–55%, 2–3 yr: 25–40%, 3+ yr: 10–25%
(Important: If the brand is not listed, infer depreciation logic based on spec tier and market trend from similar Chinese OEMs)
(Important: If any of these percentages are outdated or inaccurate, please use the most realistic current market data to adjust them in the certificate. Use your best judgment based on real-world resale pricing trends.)

---

📊 **Condition Rating**
- Provide a clear **device score out of 10**
- Explain what the score means:
  - 9–10: Excellent (like new)
  - 7–8: Good
  - 5–6: Fair
  - Below 5: Needs repair or not ideal for resale

---

📄 **Certificate Generation (Important!)**
✅ Your **first response must be a certificate layout** — do not describe, explain, or summarize anything before the certificate.

- Generate a clean, professional, and trustworthy **resale certificate**
- Preferably in **PDF** or **image format**
  - If that's not possible, output a text layout that mimics a real certificate for rendering or screenshotting

The certificate must:
- Visually **look like an official certificate** (with border, title, structured info, layout blocks, sections, seal/badge/watermark)
- Include:
  - Device name, brand, model, specs, OS version
  - Battery health and storage
  - Estimated resale value
  - Condition rating
  - A **Certificate ID** (e.g. CERT-XYZ-1234)
  - A footer message:
    > _Certified with $appName – check your phone's value and health for free using $appName (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teamz.lab.debugger)_

- Also include:
  - "Valid until: $validUntil"
  - "Scan again next month to track resale trends."

---

🔁 Ensure your output:
- Starts **immediately with the certificate**
- Is clear, professional, and trustworthy
- Is easy to copy/share with potential buyers or friends

---
